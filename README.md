# Fermat Tokens

<br>
## Introduction

Fermat Tokens are the native application tokens of the Fermat system. End users need these tokens to pay for licenses of paid Fermat APPs and to pay for bandwidh to the Fermat Network's miners.

An in depth descripcion of Fermat Tokens can be found at the [Fermat White Paper](https://github.com/bitDubai/fermat/blob/master/FERMAT-WHITE-PAPER.md).

Currently there is no automated system to issue Fermat Tokens as the Fermat Blockchain has not been released, nevertheless several tokens had been issued already and here we keep track of them.

## Early Issuing

### Founders Tokens

Fermat was founded in 2014 by a group of people that defined the vision and worked on the arquitecture of the system. By that time Fermat Tokens were worthless since no one had ever bought any of them. For their contribution founders got the first batch of 2.1 million Fermat Tokens, representing 10.00% of the 21 million to be ever issued.

### First Tokens Sale

Early 2015 a first token sale was closed. 333,333 Fermat tokens where sold for 200K USD setting the price at 1 Fermat = 0.60 USD.

## Monthy Issuing

There are three development programs running that contribute on a monthly basis to the project and Fermat tokens are issued to compensate these contributions.

### Contribution Program Tokens

Every month new tokens are issued according to the [CONTRIBUTION PROGRAM](https://github.com/bitDubai/contribution-program) to pay for contributions done to the project. Below you can see the details of tokens issued related to this program.
